Opsview scripts
==========

This repository contains scripts that I have compiled for personal use.  They are free to modify for your own use but I will attempt to make them as generic as possible.

Instructions
--------------
 1. Copy check_* to /use/local/nagios/libexec
 2. chmod +x the files
 3. chown to your nagios user
